# Computing Research Project

## Introduction

A Computing Research Project (CRP) is a comprehensive and independent study undertaken by individuals or groups in the field of computing. The goal of a CRP is to explore a particular topic or problem in computing and to produce original research findings.

The process typically involves a thorough investigation of the current state of research on the topic, the development of a research plan, the collection and analysis of data, and the presentation of the findings in a report or paper. CRPs can be conducted at the undergraduate or graduate level, and they may involve collaboration with other researchers or organizations.

Some examples of topics that may be studied in a CRP include artificial intelligence, computer security, software engineering, data science, and computer graphics. The results of a CRP can have significant practical applications, such as the development of new software, the improvement of existing systems, or the advancement of knowledge in the field.
